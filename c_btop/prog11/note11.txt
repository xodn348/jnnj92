• What structures are
• How to declare and define data structures
• How to use structures and pointers to structures
• How you can use pointers as structure members
• How to share memory between variables
• How to define your own data types
• How to write a program that produces bar charts from your data

1. structure : a collection of data items of different types as a single unit

type is horse and structure.
age, height are structure members.
Silver is instance of horse.
ex)
struct horse
{
    int age;
    int height;
    char name[20];
    char father[20];
    char mother[20];
};

struct horse Dobbin = {
                    24, 17,"Dobbin", "Trigger", "Flossie"};

or 
struct horse Piebald, Bandy;

2. Accessing structure members
Dobbin.age = 12;
Dobbin.height = 15;
strcpy(Dobbin.name, "Dobbin");
strcpy(Dobbin.father, "Trigger");
strcpy(Dobbin.mother, "Flossie");

period(.) is called member selection operator.
