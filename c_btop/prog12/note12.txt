Ch12. Working with Files
• What a file is in C
• How files are processed
• How to write and read formatted files and binary files
• How to retrieve data from a file by direct random access to the information
• How to use temporary work files in a program
• How to update binary files
• How to write a file viewer program


- Text file
1. File stream
: a sequence of bytes in memory that represents a file.
    ex) text file(seris of characters), binary file(seris of bytes), etc.


2. file pointer
: open a file and return a pointer to the file stream.(1 pointer at a file)
    ex)FILE *fopen(char *name, char *mode);

3. file mode
: a string that specifies the mode in which the file is opened.
    ex) with double quotes, working only with character strings.
    "r" for reading, 
    "w" for writing, 
    "a" for appending, 
    "r+" for reading and writing, etc.

4. file stream
: a sequence of bytes in memory that represents a file.

5. fopen
: open a file and return a pointer to the file stream.(max 5 files at a time)
    ex)FILE *fopen(char *name, char *mode);

6. fclose
: close a file.
    ex)int fclose(FILE *stream);
    cf) EOF : end of file(value -1)
    cf) fflush() : flush the buffer to the file

7. remove
: delete a file.
    ex)int remove(char *name);

8. rename
: rename a file.
    ex)int rename(char *oldname, char *newname);

9. fputs() vs fputc()
: write a string to a file. 
    ex)int fputs(char *str, FILE *stream);
    ex)int fputc(int c, FILE *stream);

10. fgets() vs fgetc()
: read a string from a file.
    ex)char *fgets(char *str, int n, FILE *stream);
    ex)int fgetc(FILE *stream);

11. fprintf() vs fscanf()
: write a formatted string to a file.(formatted input/output, start with pointer parameter)
    ex)fprintf(pfile, "%12d%12d%14f", num1, num2, fnum1);
    ex)fscanf(pfile, "%12d%12d%14f", &num1, &num2, &fnum1);

12. rewind()
: move the file pointer/current position to the beginning of the file.
    ex)rewind(pfile);

13. fflush()
: flush the buffer to the file.(write <> read)
    ex)fflush(pfile);

14. fseek()
: move the file pointer to the specified position.
    ex)fseek(pfile, 0L, SEEK_SET);

- Binary file(written in hexadecimal number)
1. wb vs rb vs ab
: write, read, append

2. fread()
: read a binary file.
    ex)fread(pfile, sizeof(int), 1, pfile);

3. fwrite()
: write a binary file.
    ex)char *filename = "myfile.bin";
        FILE *pfile = fopen(filename, "wb");
