# ch6 Applications with strings and text
1. 
\ : back slash(escape character)
\0 : null character(not to be confused with NULL, and you write it as \0.)

2. 
char saying[20];
The variable saying that you’ve declared in this statement can accommodate a string that has
up to 19 characters, because you must allow one element for the termination character.

3. 
const char message[] = "The end of the world is nigh";
printf("\nThe message is: %s", message);
This technique for defining standard messages is particularly useful if they’re used in various places within a program

4. 
while(str1[count])
count++;

The ASCII code value for the '\0' character is zero which corresponds to the Boolean value false. All other
ASCII code values are nonzero and therefore correspond to the Boolean value true. Thus the loop will continue as
long as str1[count] is not '\0', which is precisely what you want.

5. strcpy(): copy str2 to str1
strcpy(str1, str2);

strncpy(): copy n characters from str2 to str1
strncpy(str1, str2, n);

6. strlen(): return the length of the string(excluding the null character '\0')
strlen(str);
size_t needs <stddef.h> / unsigned int

7. strcat(): concatenate str2 to the end of str1
strcat(str1, str2);

8. strncat(): concatenate n characters from str2 to the end of str1
strncat(str1, str2, n);

9. pointer : variable that contains the address of another variable
char* = pointer to char

cf) avoid crash
if(pGot_char != NULL)
printf("Character found was %c.", *pGot_char);

10. strchr() : search for the first occurrence of a character in a string
strchr(str, c);

strrchr() : search for the last occurrence of a character in a string
strrchr(str, c);

11. strstr() : search for the first occurrence of a string within another string
strstr(str1, str2);
cf) case sensitive

12. strcmp() : compare two strings
strcmp(str1, str2);

13. gets() : read a string from the keyboard
gets(str);

cf)
scanf() : accept input from the keyboard, but it interprets a space as the end of an input value. 
gets() : it will read all the characters up to the Enter key. stores as string and appends '0 automatically.

reading from a file
if(gets(buffer) == NULL)
{
    printf("Error reading input.");
    return 1; /* End the program */
}
